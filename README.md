# Ruby on Rails: Adress Book Project

Based on 'free code camp' tutorial found at
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org


This project creates a simple address book app. 
The App shows a table of all the address entries, along with a single page to view each entry.
It uses basic user authentication to create private address book entries for each user_id.
Each user can only read, update & delete their own address book records.


## What I learnt during this project:
--------------------
- Installing ruby on a Mac
- Ruby 'generate' functions to create:
    - controller, view, routes
    - scaffolding for database & corresponding CRUD function
    - migrating database
- Rails fundamentals regarding partials, routes, syntax
- Installing the `devise` gem package for user login/ logout access control.
- Create DB `belongs_to` and `has_many` associations.
- Manually updating database schema file and all other associated files to add a new field to a database, then migrate to database.
- Editing controller to add 
    - 'before_action' logic 
    - created new function to prevent user editing other users data
