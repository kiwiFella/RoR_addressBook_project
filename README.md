# My first ever experience with Ruby

Based on tutorial found at: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org


What I have learnt:
--------------------
- Installing ruby on a Mac
- Ruby magic generate functions to create:
    - controller, view, routes
    - scaffolding for database & corresponding CRUD function
    - migrating database
- Rails fundamentals regarding partials, routes, syntax

- Using the `devise` gem package for login/ logout access control

 

# My Ideas:
The tutorial is very basic - here are my idea's to take the tutorial further to learn common tasks i would face in real world.

WIP:

1. re-order table columns
2. filter a DB result
3. learn how the assets/ image calls work on RoR
4. learn how the email functions work & any server setup (send email)
5. setup 2FA devise login
6. setup SSO/ SAML login

# Setup:


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
